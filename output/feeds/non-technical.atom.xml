I was incredibly lucky to be &lt;a href="http://blog.websummit.net/student-blog-announcement/"&gt;selected as one of the 22 initial Student Scholars&lt;/a&gt; to give free attendance to Web Summit Dublin 2014. When I was applying little did I know how awesome this experience will be. When they told us that we were selected out of 6,600 applicants (final figure was apparently at 15,000 for all rounds), I was a bit skeptical. When I saw the list of people I was supposed to be going to the Summit with, my only thought was: "I don't belong here".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it got to term time I did not quite have the brain capacity to worry about this. But somehow, when it eventually got to the Summit itself, I was not sure what to expect. I did not know anyone from the group of scholars and even the arrangements from the Summit with regards to our arrival were very much in the start up mentality -- hectic and required some figuring out. (That is not to blame the team at all, everything that was supposed to work, worked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2 am bus ride to catch my 6 am flight was somewhat annoying, but hey, if it is to go such an amazing event, why not. Actually, it feels kind of boring to travel during regular hours. Already on the bus to the hotel, I met up with two other scholars and I immediately felt at home: super interesting people one of whom went to business school the other to medical school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day we did some serious sightseeing with those who arrived a bit early, as the first event was in the evening. Some people really wanted to go on the Hop On, Hop Off bus tour, which I though was quite touristy, but felt like I should try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" alt="Excited tourists" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" alt="Yay bus tour!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely no regrets, we got to see a lot of Dublin that we normally would not have any time to see. Then it was time for our first pub crawl. These were integrated into Web Summit and there was even a special pub crawl for the scholars with some of the more successful companies at the Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise that the networking was awesome. But what is far more important: it felt really natural. I always hated networking for the sake of networking. I wanted to meet new people and make friends. And if they happen to be useful connections, great. If not, it's still a win, you have an awesome friend. That is really what made it so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we were escorted to dinner at Guinness factory, where on the top floor some speakers (Drew Houston!!!) along with scholars were all having dinner. I think I even shook Drew's hand so that already made me quite happy. Plus I just casually happened to speak to the CEO of Idea Paint. Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the dinner we moved to the Night Summit, which was a street rented out by Web Summit so that the attendees of the Summit can wind down and talk to each other over a pint. I think I came home at about 2 or 3 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" alt="Guiness Dinner with Drew et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" alt="Yay start up exhibition hall!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, it was start of the Summit's main part, which was absolutely &lt;em&gt;mind-blowing&lt;/em&gt;. So many awesome start-ups to talk to, the picture above only barely describe my excitement when I saw the main exhibition hall. But also, there were about seven stages that were full of the super stars of tech community: Tim O'Reilly (sorry for the bad picture), Peter Thiel (I missed the book signing :( ), GitHub CTO and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" alt="Tim O'Reilly" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" alt="Peter Thiel" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Night Summit made me happy to be missing sleep again. But we went to have drinks at the Lord Mayor of Dublin, which was amazing. Though at that time I was already spoiled, as earlier in the day we saw an opening of NASDAQ from Dublin by the Prime Minister of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" alt="NASDAQ Opening. NBD." align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" alt="Lord Mayor of Dublin" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the last day had so much to offer: Bono, Dana Burnetti and many others. Paddy Cosgrave the main organizer handled everything excellently, though he was pointing out the issues with WiFi and how that is not really their fault a bit too often. (Though to me that did not pose a problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" alt="Bono et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" alt="Dana Burnetti" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also a week full of incredible occurrences: I randomly happened to speak to the founder of Twitch, without even knowing. One other scholar was just finishing his homework in the lobby of our hotel and happened to stumble upon Dave McClure -- the founder of 500 Start-ups -- the person who just a day earlier said on stage: "If you are going to pitch to my f*cking face [without being invited to], I am not going to listen to you". But at this time Dave was trying to set-up Node.js (&lt;a href="hack-zurich-14.html"&gt;framework that we all love&lt;/a&gt;) and my fellow scholar who happened to know Node got an internship offer for this one act of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" alt="The Kooks!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" alt="Dave McClure" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other story that I still struggle to believe is that the Kooks happened to be playing without many people even knowing about it in one of the Night Summit venues. I only found out about that less than an hour before the show from a friend of mine when we just happened to be randomly talking about what we are doing tonight. He forwarded me an email (that already was forwarded at least 5 times) that was saying that Kooks will be playing in one of the venues. I don't think that it was that the organizers were trying to hide this event -- it's just that so much else awesome was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, words cannot describe how amazing this event was. I have learned so much from other Summit attendees, especially the scholars. I have had many interesting, fun and inspiring conversations. So if you are still in university, keep an eye out! Organizers promised they will do it again next year and you don't want to miss that!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Summit"></category><category term="non-technical"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Start-up"></category></entry><entry><title>#hackZurich 2014: A hackhathon to remember</title><link href="/hack-zurich-14.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-12T20:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:,2014-10-12:hack-zurich-14.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you work with a lot of engineers, you start to envy all those cool personal projects they have and all those cryptic plug-ins they know and have mastered. A lot of this happened at Hackathons. So I wanted to try one myself to have a proper experience of trying to code up an app from scratch in less than 42 hours. So when I found about hackZurich, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I was. The hackathon looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;: more sponsors than any society or event I've seen. Cool APIs opened only for hackZurich and &lt;em&gt;they even reimbursed most of travel costs.&lt;/em&gt; The only annoying this was that this event was happening around exam time. But seeing as I am writing elaborate odes on this, you can probably guess what I chose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was not that easy: I knew I wanted to go to a hackathon, except I've never been before. And there was an application process. Realistically, I am not sure how selective it was, but there was a cap of 300 people and given that there are always freebies and free food, I think hackathons can be quite appealing.... at least for me. But I mean we had to sleep on the ground, on the tables and on our bags and some people did not even have sleeping bags. I do not want it to sounds like I am complaining. No one actually slept a whole lot (I slept about 4 hours first night and one hour the second) so no one really cared. I found my own non-lit corridor and slept on the floor, because I really need quiet environment. But hey! It was a fun experience and I was worried I am getting a little snobby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hacking! We had about 30-40 hours to code an app on any topic, but noting of course that some companies gave us exclusive (and some promoted only their existing) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; for us to try something new. Except, as a person knowledgeable mostly of the data science stack, I soon realized that I will need to go back to coding some web apps to have something to show. That, however, was a problem, because I have not coded up a web app in over a year. So I was afraid that I simply may not be up to the challenge skill-set wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, organizers created a Facebook group for people to get together and discuss their preliminary ideas, but standard hackathon rules apply: no code before the official kick-off. So I joined the group and was discussing ideas with people and was quite happy to see that a lot of people were not extremely concerned about the lack of specific skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I was quite nervous, because this was my first hackathon and I was not quite sure what to expect. I teamed up with a friend of mine, because I figured going to a hackathon in a different country in a busy period and coding in technologies I have never mastered and even the little experience I had was long time ago, it is going to be challenging as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We roughly discussed the idea beforehand, but as my head was full of Mathematical Methods exam that I was supposed to be taking the day before leaving, I did not quite do justice to preparation as a lot of Node JS I needed to refresh on the go and that slowed me down considerably. But let's not jump the gun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing my exam on Thursday and doing chores until my departure from Oxford shortly after noon, I was quite freaked out: I still haven't really unpacked and I was already going places. But the trip was cool: I was flying from London City Airport for the first time, which was quite exiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0752.jpg" alt="Destination: #hackZurich" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not knowing anything about Zurich, I perfectly navigated and caught the pre-planned (from about a week ago!) train straight to the hackathon venue, which made my day. Hackathon itself was held at a &lt;a href="http://technopark.ch"&gt;TechnoPark&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed to be a quite modern open space for start-ups and small companies. Upon arrival, I got my badge and bag of goodies that I still haven't fully explored, because there's just &lt;em&gt;so much stuff.&lt;/em&gt;  (Yay!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I unfortunately missed the opening ceremony, but I arrived just in time for the pretty cool workshops: Evernote had an introduction to their APIs and Software Development Kits and then I went to presentation about Google wearables. Where Google-certified android master (presenter) sent a guy who wanted to go to the Apple workshop to the 6th floor (where there was no workshop) and after the poor guy left, he said: "Ooops, I must have been using Apple Maps." The sass is strong with this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the workshops, &lt;strong&gt;let the hacking commence.&lt;/strong&gt; My friend and I were using MEAN stack and &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.JS&lt;/a&gt; to build a budget tracking app. That is &lt;a href="http://mongodb.org"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express.JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular.JS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.JS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was challenging doing all this coding, but I have to say, quite fun. The atmosphere was amazing and a ton of caffeinated drinks around. Here and there was an occasional food shortage, but hey: free food. After the kick-off people, obviously, started coding. And they coded... until 430 am. At which point I decided that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a good idea to get some rest and so I finally managed to find a nice hallway to sleep in by about 5 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10689898_10203303761088371_4719824619037743016_n.jpg?oh=e9683900216a3692b0ca916a2be2f27c&amp;oe=54AE910E" align="center" alt="4 am #hackZurich" style="width: 620px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think that was bad? Check out where some of these poor souls have been sleeping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BztdrGDCEAMmoY6.jpg:large" align="center" style="width: 620px;" alt="People sleeping on the floor."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0772.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0777.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my effort to stow myself away I was woken up several times by people sneaking through my corridor to find an even more obscure corridor to sleep in, which sometimes looked quite weird, not to mention awkward, especially if you make eye contact. Anyways, I woke up by 8:30 am to sounds of some radio (&lt;strong&gt;rage&lt;/strong&gt;) and since I was up and I got breakfast and started working. Morning was quite productive, but after a while we got quite tired and hungry and so we went on a walking tour of Zurich that organizers kindly organized for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0762.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;1
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0765.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0767.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;1
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0771.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say Zurich is quite an amazing city. It has a very picturesque, small-town feel and it really feels too fairly-taily to be true.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night was a bit more rough as we had issues with our database and Node.JS not being synchronized, which is one of the pains of working with asynchronous stacks, which took us quite a long time to fix. I stopped working at around 4:30 and got up at 6 something to go finish our app before the 930 am deadline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our app did not make it into finals--as those were only for 1/4 of the participants--but this hackathon was definitely awesome. Would do again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I yammered for too long again, I will leave it at that, but I will be back for more!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="hackathon"></category><category term="non-technical"></category></entry></feed>
