&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to start a blog and my recent involvement in the &lt;a href="http://goodjudgmentproject.com/"&gt;Good Judgment Project (GJP)&lt;/a&gt;, part of  &lt;a href="http://iarpa.gov"&gt;Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity's (IARPA)&lt;/a&gt; ACE Project, proved to be a decent excuse to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have joined GJP mid-Season 3 (hence I haven't participated fully) and then I tested into season 4 (combination of general intelligence test and political knowledge).
