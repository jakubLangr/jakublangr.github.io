&lt;p&gt;By this point you probably are already aware of the fact that this is a blog of a slightly eccentric individual. And for some reason decided to stay. You're a persistent one, aren't you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Oxford, studied &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain"&gt;very questionable degree&lt;/a&gt; and did some statistics/economics. I also was kind of crazy about the whole Massive Online Open Courses thing and forgot that real world existed. Then one day, after an intervention from my friends and family, I realized I should probably get off these MOOCs, but it was too late. I already finished 18 of them. But hey, at least I can remember playing with machine learning, data science, statistics, computer science and all the things awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working in Data Science at a couple of startups (Mudano and Filtered, plus some smaller ones), at Entrepreneur First, Pearson Plc (all in London last two years), but I also have full-time like experience from international consultancies and NGOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I spend some time doing improv and updating this website.&lt;/p&gt;
