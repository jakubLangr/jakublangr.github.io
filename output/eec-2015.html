				title="Permalink to Speaking at European Economic Congress 2015">Speaking at European Economic Congress 2015</a>
		</h1>
		<p>I was recently invited to speak at European Economic Congress in Poland partially thanks to the fact that I was working at Aspen Institute Prague back in the summer of 2011. I was sort of skeptical, but when I saw the line-up for my panel all of that disappeared almost immediately. In fact, I was sort of expecting that with these sort of people why should anyone care what I had to say. </p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/panel.png" alt="Panel line up" align='center' /></p>
<p>When I got to the airport, there was even a guy standing with my name (laminated!) on it waiting to escort me to the hotel. That freaked me out a little bit. But enough about this. Katowice was an interesting city: marred by Communist rule and somewhat this felt like a journey back in time -- recalling my childhood days in Prague. Poland was noticeably different from Czech Republic, but was eerily similar in many of the functionalist buildings and people's attitudes. </p>
<p>So before delving into the trouble of entrepreneurship, I would like to address one thing that highly bothered me. After <a href="/web-summit-dublin-14.html">Web Summit Dublin (a tech conference)</a>, I was sort of expecting that I would be moving into a less male dominated space. Unfortunately, I was proved wrong. The ratio of men to women was highly disproportional (in favor of men, obviously) and in tech I at the very least think that there are reasonable arguments--whether or not they are true is beyond my knowledge of sociology or neuroscience--why this is not due to some systematic bias or lack of meritocracy. In business, there is just simply no excuse. But look at the pictures to see how strong the disbalance there is. In fact, Aspen Institute Prague did probably the best out of all those concerned--half of the team (including the operating boss) were women. But it gets worse: almost all of people in the promotional stalls and serving food were women. Almost model-like, made to look pretty at the stalls to attract the males to notice their company as if women had no other role. Quite disturbing. </p>
<p>I think especially in Central and Eastern Europe where women have so much to contribute in the business world. I think that this region is missing out on a lot: not only a lot of talent, but also a different a bit softer and smarter approach would surely benefit the business performance of all these countries. (The fact that it also is probably a lot nicer to work/live in such an environment.) I know that I probably should not speak badly of the organizers given that they have paid for me to be there, but I think an international conference should be the first to push forth such an agenda. I do not want to seem ungrateful, but the contrast was just too stark and if the conference wants to aspire to be a truly European Economic Congress, it should aspire to also inspire a positive change in the society.</p>
<p><img src='...' alt='Conference' /></p>
<p>I am ending the rant now. The conference itself was held in a fabulous newly built Conference Center in the middle of Katowice. The conference was started off by the then President of Poland Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski. Despite not being explicitly on the agenda, he started discussing the issue of entrepreneurship quite a lot: the issue of retaining talent, attracting investors and so on. Although there were no concrete plans, I still appreciated this as a very important signal as well as the recognition that entrepreneurship is hard and if we want to succeed we must embrace failure. </p>
<p>PICS!</p>
<p>All of these notions were then repeated during my panel discussion and I even got a few shout-outs from others such as " As the gentleman on the far-right [of the panel] noted--without alluding to his political views--the young need to be willing to fail", as mentioned by the German ambassador. Though I was the only one to laugh at that remark, which was quite embarrassing. </p>
