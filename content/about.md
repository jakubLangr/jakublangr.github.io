Summary: About Me

![Me](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/WebSummit_011.JPG "Welcome to my blog!")

By this point you probably are already aware of the fact that this is a blog of a slightly eccentric individual. And for some reason decided to stay. You're a persistent one, aren't you?

I went to Oxford, studied [very questionable degree](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) and did some statistics/economics. I also was kind of crazy about the whole Massive Online Open Courses thing and forgot that real world existed. Then one day, after an intervention from my friends and family, I realized I should probably get off these MOOCs, but it was too late. I already finished 18 of them. But hey, at least I can remember playing with machine learning, data science, statistics, computer science and all the things awesome.

I was working at a couple of startups, at Entrepreneur First, Pearson Plc (all in London last two years), but I also have full-time like experience from international consultancies and NGOs. 

Now I spend some time doing improv and updating this website.
