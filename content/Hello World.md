# ... or quick and dirty statistical modelling in R

Recently, I decided to start a blog and my recent involvement in the [Good Judgment Project (GJP)](http://goodjudgmentproject.com/), part of  [Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity's (IARPA)](http://www.iarpa.gov) ACE Project, proved to be a decent excuse to do so. 

I have joined GJP mid-Season 3 (hence I haven't participated fully) and then I tested into season 4 (combination of general intelligence test and political knowledge). This test alone was a treat, becasue it followed all the guidelines about best practicies of hiring (to my knowledge) and it turned out to be fun just to do that. What I did not know at the time is that only one in ten will actually be accepted into GJP, otherwise I would probably put in a lot more work into the test.

Anyway, the fourth season
