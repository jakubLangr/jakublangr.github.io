I was incredibly lucky to be &lt;a href="http://blog.websummit.net/student-blog-announcement/"&gt;selected as one of the Student Scholars&lt;/a&gt; to give free attendance to Web Summit Dublin 2014. When I was applying little did I know how awesome this experience will be. When they told us that we were selected out of 6,600 applicants (final figure was apparently at 15,000 for all rounds), I was a bit skeptical. When I saw the list of people I was supposed to be going to the Summit with, my only thought was: "I don't belong here".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it got to term time I did not quite have the brain capacity to worry about this. But somehow, when it eventually got to the Summit itself, I was not sure what to expect. I did not know anyone from the group of scholars and even the arrangements from the Summit with regards to our arrival were very much in the start up mentality -- hectic and required some figuring out. (That is not to blame the team at all, everything that was supposed to work, worked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2 am bus ride to catch my 6 am flight was somewhat annoying, but hey, if it is to go such an amazing event, why not. Actually, it feels kind of boring to travel during regular hours. Already on the bus to the hotel, I met up with two other scholars and I immediately felt at home: super interesting people one of whom went to business school the other to medical school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day we did some serious sightseeing with those who arrived a bit early, as the first event was in the evening. Some people really wanted to go on the Hop On, Hop Off bus tour, which I though was quite touristy, but felt like I should try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" alt="Excited tourists" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" alt="Yay bus tour!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely no regrets, we got to see a lot of Dublin that we normally would not have any time to see. Then it was time for our first pub crawl. These were integrated into Web Summit and there was even a special pub crawl for the scholars with some of the more successful companies at the Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise that the networking was awesome. But what is far more important: it felt really natural. I always hated networking for the sake of networking. I wanted to make friends. And if they happen to be useful connections, great. If not, it's still a win, you have an awesome friend. That is really what made it so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we were escorted to dinner at Guinness factory, where on the top floor us and some speakers (Drew Houston!!!) were all having dinner. I think I even shook Drew's hand so that already made me quite happy. Plus I just casually happened to speak to the CEO of Idea Paint. Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we moved to the Night Summit, which was a street rented out by Web Summit so that the attendees of the Summit can wind down and talk to each other over a pint. I think I came home at about 2 or 3 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" alt="Guiness Dinner with Drew et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" alt="Yay start up exhibition hall!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, it was start of the Summit's main part, which was absolutely &lt;em&gt;mind-blowing&lt;/em&gt;. So many awesome start-ups to talk to, the picture above only barely describes my excitement when I saw the main exhibition hall. But also, there were about seven stages that were full of the super stars of tech community: Tim O'Reilly (sorry for the bad picture), Peter Thiel (I missed the book signing :( ), GitHub CTO and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" alt="Tim O'Reilly" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" alt="Peter Thiel" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Night Summit made me happy to be missing sleep again. But we went to have drinks at the Lord Mayor of Dublin, which was amazing. Though at that time I was already spoiled, as earlier in the day we saw an opening of NASDAQ from Dublin by the Prime Minister of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" alt="NASDAQ Opening. NBD." align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" alt="Lord Mayor of Dublin" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the last day had so much to offer: Bono, Dana Burnetti and many others. Paddy Cosgrave the main organizer handled everything excellently, though he was pointing out the issues with WiFi and how that is not really their fault a bit too often. (Though to me that did not pose a problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" alt="Bono et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" alt="Dana Burnetti" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also a week full of incredible occurrences: I randomly happened to speak to the founder of Twitch, without even knowing. One other scholar was just finishing his homework in the lobby of our hotel and happened to stumble upon Dave McClure -- the founder of 500 Start-ups -- the person who just a day earlier said on stage: "If you are going to pitch to my f*cking face, I am not going to listen to you". But at this time Dave was trying to set-up Node.js (&lt;a href="hack-zurich-14.html"&gt;framework that we all love&lt;/a&gt;) and my fellow scholar who happened to know Node got an internship offer for this one act of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" alt="The Kooks!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" alt="Dave McClure" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other story that I still struggle to believe is that the Kooks happened to be playing without many people even knowing about it in one of the Night Summit venues. I only found out about that less than an hour before the show from a friend of mine when we just randomly talking that forwarded me an email (that already was forwarded at least 5 times). I don't think that it was that the organizers were trying to hide this event -- it's just that so much else awesome was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, words cannot describe how amazing this event was. I have learned so much from other Summit attendees, especially the scholars. I have had many interesting, fun and inspiring conversations. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Summit"></category><category term="non-technical"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Start-up"></category></entry><entry><title>#hackZurich 2014: A hackhathon to remember</title><link href="/hack-zurich-14.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-12T20:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:,2014-10-12:hack-zurich-14.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you work with a lot of engineers, you start to envy all those cool personal projects they have and all those cryptic plug-ins they know and have mastered. A lot of this happened at Hackathons. So I wanted to try one myself to have a proper experience of trying to code up an app from scratch in less than 42 hours. So when I found about hackZurich, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I was. The hackathon looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;: more sponsors than any society or event I've seen. Cool APIs opened only for hackZurich and &lt;em&gt;they even reimbursed most of travel costs.&lt;/em&gt; The only annoying this was that this event was happening around exam time. But seeing as I am writing elaborate odes on this, you can probably guess what I chose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was not that easy: I knew I wanted to go to a hackathon, except I've never been before. And there was an application process. Realistically, I am not sure how selective it was, but there was a cap of 300 people and given that there are always freebies and free food, I think hackathons can be quite appealing.... at least for me. But I mean we had to sleep on the ground, on the tables and on our bags and some people did not even have sleeping bags. I do not want it to sounds like I am complaining. No one actually slept a whole lot (I slept about 4 hours first night and one hour the second) so no one really cared. I found my own non-lit corridor and slept on the floor, because I really need quiet environment. But hey! It was a fun experience and I was worried I am getting a little snobby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hacking! We had about 30-40 hours to code an app on any topic, but noting of course that some companies gave us exclusive (and some promoted only their existing) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; for us to try something new. Except, as a person knowledgeable mostly of the data science stack, I soon realized that I will need to go back to coding some web apps to have something to show. That, however, was a problem, because I have not coded up a web app in over a year. So I was afraid that I simply may not be up to the challenge skill-set wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, organizers created a Facebook group for people to get together and discuss their preliminary ideas, but standard hackathon rules apply: no code before the official kick-off. So I joined the group and was discussing ideas with people and was quite happy to see that a lot of people were not extremely concerned about the lack of specific skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I was quite nervous, because this was my first hackathon and I was not quite sure what to expect. I teamed up with a friend of mine, because I figured going to a hackathon in a different country in a busy period and coding in technologies I have never mastered and even the little experience I had was long time ago, it is going to be challenging as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We roughly discussed the idea beforehand, but as my head was full of Mathematical Methods exam that I was supposed to be taking the day before leaving, I did not quite do justice to preparation as a lot of Node JS I needed to refresh on the go and that slowed me down considerably. But let's not jump the gun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing my exam on Thursday and doing chores until my departure from Oxford shortly after noon, I was quite freaked out: I still haven't really unpacked and I was already going places. But the trip was cool: I was flying from London City Airport for the first time, which was quite exiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0752.jpg" alt="Destination: #hackZurich" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not knowing anything about Zurich, I perfectly navigated and caught the pre-planned (from about a week ago!) train straight to the hackathon venue, which made my day. Hackathon itself was held at a &lt;a href="http://technopark.ch"&gt;TechnoPark&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed to be a quite modern open space for start-ups and small companies. Upon arrival, I got my badge and bag of goodies that I still haven't fully explored, because there's just &lt;em&gt;so much stuff.&lt;/em&gt;  (Yay!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I unfortunately missed the opening ceremony, but I arrived just in time for the pretty cool workshops: Evernote had an introduction to their APIs and Software Development Kits and then I went to presentation about Google wearables. Where Google-certified android master (presenter) sent a guy who wanted to go to the Apple workshop to the 6th floor (where there was no workshop) and after the poor guy left, he said: "Ooops, I must have been using Apple Maps." The sass is strong with this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the workshops, &lt;strong&gt;let the hacking commence.&lt;/strong&gt; My friend and I were using MEAN stack and &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.JS&lt;/a&gt; to build a budget tracking app. That is &lt;a href="http://mongodb.org"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express.JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular.JS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.JS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was challenging doing all this coding, but I have to say, quite fun. The atmosphere was amazing and a ton of caffeinated drinks around. Here and there was an occasional food shortage, but hey: free food. After the kick-off people, obviously, started coding. And they coded... until 430 am. At which point I decided that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a good idea to get some rest and so I finally managed to find a nice hallway to sleep in by about 5 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10689898_10203303761088371_4719824619037743016_n.jpg?oh=e9683900216a3692b0ca916a2be2f27c&amp;oe=54AE910E" align="center" alt="4 am #hackZurich" style="width: 620px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think that was bad? Check out where some of these poor souls have been sleeping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BztdrGDCEAMmoY6.jpg:large" align="center" style="width: 620px;" alt="People sleeping on the floor."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my effort to stow myself away I was woken up several times by people sneaking through my corridor to find an even more obscure corridor to sleep in, which sometimes looked quite weird, not to mention awkward, especially if you make eye contact. Anyways, I woke up by 8:30 am to sounds of some radio (&lt;strong&gt;rage&lt;/strong&gt;) and since I was up and I got breakfast and started working. Morning was quite productive, but after a while we got quite tired and hungry and so we went on a walking tour of Zurich that organizers kindly organized for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0762.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;1
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0765.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/IMAG0767.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;1

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say Zurich is quite an amazing city. It has a very picturesque, small-town feel and it really feels too fairly-taily to be true.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night was a bit more rough as we had issues with our database and Node.JS not being synchronized, which is one of the pains of working with asynchronous stacks, which took us quite a long time to fix. I stopped working at around 4:30 and got up at 6 something to go finish our app before the 930 am deadline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our app did not make it into finals--as those were only for 1/4 of the participants--but this hackathon was definitely awesome. Would do again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I yammered for too long again, I will leave it at that, but I will be back for more!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="hackathon"></category><category term="non-technical"></category></entry><entry><title>Tracking the CrISIS in Syria</title><link href="/tracking-crisis.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-22T21:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:,2014-09-22:tracking-crisis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are interested more in the analysis of the conflict from a quantitative persective and not so much in the methodology, you &lt;a href='#explore'&gt; can jump straight there.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was working as a contractor this summer, I came across a very interesting project called &lt;a href="http://www.gdeltproject.org/"&gt;GDELT&lt;/a&gt; -- Global Database of Events, Language and Tone. This project I think is best described by the official website statement: "GDELT Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, counts, themes, sources, and events driving our global society every second of every day, creating a free open platform for computing on the entire world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, as a part of &lt;a href="../hello-world.html"&gt;Good Judgement Project&lt;/a&gt;, I was made to forecast on Syria and ISIS' actions. As I was going through the articles describing what is happening in Syria, I became to wonder: what is the bigger picture? To what extent is this hype all just because &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS is the headline-grabber in the West? (But of course, no one cares until it becomes a story in the public consciousness.) That's when GDELT comes into the picture. I wanted to try it as I came across it, but since I was finishing my data science project, I did not quite have the time. I was awe-struck by the complexity and potential of it so I knew I wanted to give a go. I have not really used R all that extensively in about a year since my internship, but I am not afraid of large analytics, so I decided to refresh those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Google was so nice as to host this almost 100 GB dataset on &lt;a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.cz/2014/05/worlds-largest-event-dataset-now-publicly-available-in-google-bigquery.html"&gt;its cloud for free&lt;/a&gt;, for which I love Google. Not only that, but Google also loaded this dataset so that it can be queried using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuertracky"&gt;BigQuery&lt;/a&gt; using public-facing APIs or a web interface. We can then query GDELT using SQL-like language as shown below and subsequently export the dataset as a CSV:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor1Geo_CountryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor1Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;IMG&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor1Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;REB&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor2Geo_CountryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor2Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;IMG&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Actor2Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;REB&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(For those interested, I include a smaller version of the dataset I was working with after exporting from GDELT &lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/sample.csv"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption of this endeavor is that if I include non-English media (and perhaps the less main-stream ones too) by using GDELT's information rather than Google, which will always give me traditional sources, I can get a better sense of what is going on. Thanks to the the law of large numbers, I should not get too many false positives from spurious sources, so my overall analysis should remain robust and even more objective than relying on sources such as CNN or BBC alone. One additional advantage GDELT has is that it is updated every 24 hours. In theory, this analysis could be automated so that it updates itself every 24 hours. (Actually, it should not be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more work ... but given the size of GDELT, I would have to start paying for using the BigQuery service that often.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any more substantive project, there was a lot of data cleaning and obstacles. Namely: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS not recognized by GDELT&lt;/strong&gt;:
There's lots of International Militarized Groups (IMGs) recognized by GDELT, but ISIS seems to be too new in the headlines to be recognized by GDELT coding yet. Hence I had to look for substitutes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMG (International Militarized Group) tag to the rescue&lt;/strong&gt;:
There is a column specifying actor &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; (not actor name!) for each event. There is an actor type IMG, which was fortunate. However, there is no way of fully knowing whether said group is ISIS or not from this dataset. (At least with this level of granularity, but I am sure it would be technically possible, if GDELT team so chose.) I would also imagine that the fighters on the ground themselves are often not quite sure, given the number of splinter groups these organizations harbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But sometimes "REB"&lt;/strong&gt;:
When individually inspecting the events (just some of them, I do not have the time to go through the entire data dump), I quickly realized that the data pertaining to clearly ISIS attacks are sometimes labeled as "REBEL" actor type. So I needed to include both in the analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning the data&lt;/strong&gt;:
For some events it is hard, if not impossible, to correctly specify precise coordinates. As a result, GDELT merely inputs the values of the approximate center of Syria. These records obviously needed to be removed from the dataset. Obviously, there was couple of more steps that I needed to do and a couple that tricked me for a little bit, for instance, when I found that the state code of one of the events was &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt;, which, however, stood for Israel, as I later found out.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDELT project classifies each event using &lt;a href="http://gdeltproject.org/data/lookups/CAMEO.eventcodes.txt"&gt;one of their internal codes&lt;/a&gt;, each of these codes then gets then a &lt;a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~kinsella/jgscale.html"&gt;Goldstein score&lt;/a&gt;, which basically expresses whether this event whether people are being nice to each other (positive score) or mean/evil towards each other (negative score). Where +10.0 is some massive humanitarian/developmental aid project, +1.0 is probably visit of some minor national politician. All the positive things were filtered out, because I wanted to focus on what the problems were. There -1.1 is, for instance, "Deny an attributed policy, action, role or position" and -10.0 is "Military attack; clash; assault".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the more SQL-knowledgeable of you might have noticed, I only considered events that came from 2 independent sources and happened on or after March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id='explore'&gt; Let's explore &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this dataset in hand, I made several maps where I plotted each event as a point sized according to its Goldstein score and set relatively low transparency so that all hotspots appear in bright red. I plotted this dataset by month, and here's March 2013 till July 2013. We see that at the end of this period, there's was violence spearing from its initial hotspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;March and April 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201303.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201304.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;May and July 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201305.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we look at the period August till November, we see that there's a lot more violence then. But to some extent we have to bear in mind that this dataset includes &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; rebels and not just ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;August 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201308.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;September 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201309.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;October 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201310.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;November 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201311.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the connected events: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=Syria,+Chemical+Weapons&amp;date=1/2013+12m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=500&amp;h=330"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I am using Google Trends as a proxy for "Western interest" in the matter. We can see that the use of chemical drew Western attention to Syria, however, this interest was very short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, August and September are easily explained by the usage of chemical weapons. But the violence following this, especially in October and later, cannot be explained just by looking at chemical weapons, because that is when the hype ended and has not picked up until ISIS was the next important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following months were similarly violent and few in the West seemed to care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;December 2013 and January 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201312.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201401.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;February and March 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201402.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201403.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April and May 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201404.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we plot the Google trend graph again, since the start of Syrian Civil War in March 2011, we see that the attention Syria got around the times of the use of chemical weapons is unparalleled. This is hardly surprising, but what is notable is that there a &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-chemical-weapons-attack-blamed-on-assad-but-wheres-the-evidence/"&gt;disagreement regarding who actually used them&lt;/a&gt;, though I think that at least some of these attacks were sure to be made by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;cat=0-16-396&amp;q=Syria&amp;date=1/2009+43m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_1&amp;export=5&amp;w=500&amp;h=330"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the limited interested by the West, violence was actually similar to the months during which the chemical weapons were used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting that ISIS was not picked up by Western media much until recent months, despite the fact that ISIS can be traced back to 2004: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;cat=0-16-396&amp;q=%22Islamic+State%22,+ISIS,+ISIL&amp;date=today+12-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=500&amp;h=330"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, violence was hovering around the same level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;June and July 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201406.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201407.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;August and September 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201408.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="left" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/201409.png" alt="Map of Syria" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that it seems that despite the limited budget that ISIS has for its media operations, its terror tactics are largely successful: Syria is not, at least by according to this analysis, by and large, more violent than it was in the few months prior to ISIS' inclusion in the Western media's limelight. &lt;em&gt;Yet&lt;/em&gt;, ISIS get substantial amount of attention, so much so that it prodded United States and &lt;em&gt;five Arab&lt;/em&gt; states (no European states, however, at the time of writing) to launch a military operation starting today. This article used a lot of proxies so I do not want to make grandiose claims that cannot be supported by this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I think what this article shows that ISIS first and foremost is unparalleled by its usage of social media compared to other terrorist organiztations and splinter groups. If anything, it seems that the number of violent occurrences has decreased. But the terror-tactics and the headline-grabbing strategy of ISIS is already working well for them. West pays attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the brutality and the casualities is hard to really compare, because the information about the previous comparable systems (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan"&gt;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;) is very limited and we might just never get as complete picture as we have now. But now, largely thanks to GDELT, we have a much more complete dataset about the conditions within the Islamic State and so it might prove easier to benchmark the level of violence and discord in this society against all other -- be it present or future -- states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on an interactive R-Shiny app for this visualization/analysis so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to start a blog and my ongoing involvement in the &lt;a href="http://goodjudgmentproject.com/"&gt;Good Judgment Project (GJP)&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of US government's &lt;a href="http://www.iarpa.gov"&gt;Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically the ACE Project, proved to be a decent excuse to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have joined GJP mid-Season 3 (hence I haven't participated fully) and then I tested into season 4 (combination of general intelligence test and political knowledge). This test alone was a treat, because it followed all the guidelines about best practices of hiring (to my knowledge) and I knew that if I get in, this will be a lot of fun. What I did not know at the time was that only one in ten will actually be accepted into GJP, otherwise I would probably put in a lot more work into the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this mess-up, I joined a project and met my amazing fellow forecasters in my team. At the time of joining, I already knew that I will be putting numeric probabilistic values on how the world might soon turn out to be (e.g. will there be a direct Russia-Ukraine confrontation in Crimea). All of these questions are well-defined using a very sophisticated set of definitions, but making the evaluation criteria very flexible and as to allow GJP Team to 'resolve' each question in the spirit rather than the letter of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of these questions have allowed for use of publicly available datasets and so I would like to offer some code that I used to ease up my work as a forecaster. This particular example is relates to a question that resolved yesterday: If on a certain date the area of ice on the Arctic sea will be more than what it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following R code downloads, cleans and plots some time-series representation of the record ed data of the ice for the past couple of years. It is &lt;em&gt;super-simple&lt;/em&gt;, but I was able to do it from question to quantitative probabilities in about 30 minutes, so this is just to demonstrate that even such simple code can help you make a much more solid prediction. This was necessary, because my team's forecasts were all over the place (among 9 forecasters we ranged 5-80%) and statistical modeling is a great way how to deal with data that is normally quite counter-intuitive and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;library&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;TTR&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
library&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;reshape&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
library&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;tseries&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GJP purposes, the confidence intervals produced by this model are especially useful, because they give you an idea of how confident you can be in your predictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="mf"&gt;16.75704&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4852551&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4538291&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5166811&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4371932&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5333170&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the plots here can help elucidate why my team might have been all over the place: there are many factors influencing how much ice there will be on a given day: sure, there is the seasonal (summer-winter) cycle, which matters a lot, but there is also some random element as well as measurement error. I fear that lots of my fellow forecasters (perhaps including myself for a long time) fell victim to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"&gt;over-fitting&lt;/a&gt; to the random element. Sure, we could observe the pattern from the previous year, but no one from the team--to my knowledge--plotted the data to see what (approximate) influence each of the two factors have. This is why decomposition is so great:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decomposed time-series plot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30848031/blog/gjp_modelling_ts_decomposition.svg" alt="Timeseries decomposition of ice-area" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting element of the decomposition is the trend, which I was expecting to see fairly clear evidence of global warming, but instead I really found out "just" evidence of climate change. Though, of course, I am no climatologist, so perhaps that interesting dip in the year 2000 had some other (spurious?) reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decomposition, although helpful, was not what I considered the main advantage of this little exercise: I was then able to use a time-series statistical model called HoltWinters to predict the area of ice (no pun intended?), which uses exponential smoothing that is quite fitting in these conditions (I wonder whether these statistical puns significantly affect my readership?). This model is appropriate mainly because there is a lot of historical data and the data is always very constrained to a certain range (e.g. a 3 sigma change is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; extremely unlikely, which cannot be said of all financial data this model is applied to). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts about GJP itself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GJP is what I think social science should be: quantifiable, based on best-practices and aiming to get as close to the truth as possible, not tell the best story. This was, interestingly enough, the conclusion (&lt;em&gt;simplifying tremendously&lt;/em&gt;) of Professor Philip Teltock in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715"&gt;his book Expert Political Judgment&lt;/a&gt;. Namely that the political forecasters that tell the best story are usually favored by the media, because it sells well, but they tend to do worse than most others on accuracy. Professor Tetlock is now one of the main organizers of GJP and so it is a great honor to work as his lab rat, because it helps to do cutting-edge research and it helps me to learn a ton in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional gift every forecaster got from the GJP was a set of presentations of best practices of forecasting, which I think were fascinating, albeit oftentimes simple guidelines to stick to. But as with everything, it is much more a matter of putting these into practice rather that makes a great forecaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of interesting things that I noticed about myself looking at old predictions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. I am overly cautious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading loads of literature about randomness and its role in human society (Kahneman, Taleb, Tversky, Ariely, Mlodinow etc.) I was overly careful about putting down anything close to 1% or 99%, even though some questions call for it (likelihood of a massive reform of international institutions in a short timespan). Good Judgment, after all, is not only very well calibrated, but it is also very discriminating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. I struggle with randomness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting point about randomness--to some extent related to the previous one--how do we square the fact that randomness is just a model and yet we keep on invoking the properties of randomness when talking about the world. But, at least on the level of humans, each action is supposedly deterministic. Yes, some might call on the &lt;a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2014/07/04/wrong/"&gt;famous George Box quote&lt;/a&gt;, but that does not really answer why in a situation of imperfect information &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; model. This is especially confusing given the amount of strategic interaction and social influence in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a problem with with some of the GJP predictions I make, because I want to stick to randomness as a baseline (because it seems to be best practice), but then struggle to always justify this to myself and square it with the rest of information. This especially bothered me outside of GJP, however. In Mlodinow's book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Drunkards-Walk-Randomness-Rules/dp/0307275175"&gt;The Drunkard's Walk&lt;/a&gt;, he specifically used the example of production studio's CEOs as someone who is faced with great randomness in the movies. But each action in this immensely complex chain of interactions is deterministic, strategic and influenced by one's surroundings. Why is randomness an emergent property of human systems? Seems non-obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Conditional interaction is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(especially cross-culture)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a question on what would DPRK do, should the United States take a bold, but merely supportive, military action in aid of South Korea. Our team struggled to agree even if the bold action would increase chance of state DPRK being more aggressive towards South Korea or less so. Would the desire to prove something to US (or more generally, the West) outweigh the potential risks, because of the importance of the precedent or would the bold action scare off DPRK? Both ways of reasoning sounded equally plausible to me at the time so I just followed what my initial prediction was. But really, there was no reason for it. The question whether I got it right or wrong is irrelevant in this case; the question is: would I be able to make a good prediction next time? I fear that so far the answer is no and so I never swayed too far off 50%. I will probably need to devise a way of breaking these ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog! I am a final year undergraduate at University of Oxford studying mostly economics, but really just spending loads of time on &lt;a href="http://cousera.org"&gt;Cousera.org&lt;/a&gt; and similar awesome MOOC sites (I mean, I have to love them, I already finished 12 courses...) playing with machine learning, data science, statistics, computer science and all the things awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to hack data and I worked in a data science position for a half a year at Pearson Plc, but I also have full-time like experience from international consultancies and NGOs. &lt;/p&gt;
