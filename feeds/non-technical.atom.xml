&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the AI industry is incredibly broad and has many different forms and functions, so industry professionals tend to focus more deeply on which branches of AI are being hyped today. This is also true because there are greatly varying degrees of progress across the different areas of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some subfields, such as computer vision, have seen only marginal progress, whereas other areas are growing by leaps and bounds every six months. One such area is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which has developed from from synthesizing rather uninteresting 28x28 pixels images to full-HD images of human faces in about three years. These are completely novel images that require all the creativity and skills of a painter. The important part is that, for an AI practitioner, this changes the nature of how we think of AI capabilities because it means that the AI is capable of creativity. This means that AI can leave some of the more mechanical creativity to the machines and allow humans to re-focus on different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GANs are just a tool like any algorithmic breakthrough, albeit extensively applied into different sectors. For example, in medicine GANs have been used to help cancer detection¹ by creating new, realistic scans; they have been applied both defensively² and offensively³ in cybersecurity; and — cheating the expectations of many — GANs have been used in art. In fact, one of the art pieces generated by this technique sold for $432,500. There are now several artists dedicated exclusively to GANs, one of whom is Helena Sarin, whose work is pictured in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='images/data.jpg' style='vertical-align: middle; width: 95%' &gt; 
&lt;div align='center'&gt; &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Helena Sarin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation of Generative Adversarial Networks is simple at its core. It starts with two networks, one is the generator (hence generative) and the other is called the discriminator, because it discerns the work of the generator. The networks compete against each other (hence adversarial), in an attempt to outperform each other. In the example of art, the generator acts as the art student trying to fool the discriminator into accepting its works as being the ‘real’ works of great artists. Meanwhile the discriminator, like a harsh art teacher, tries to distinguish between authentic works of art and those made by the student. Through this competition and feedback, both get better at their craft. In this way, GANs mimic creativity and counter-factual reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medicine, as of mid-2018, there have been 63 medical papers published that used GANs in some capacity. These tend to focus on segmentation or synthesis in the majority of the cases and there are examples of GANs performing impressively in creatively figuring out missing information in diagnosing cardiac diseases, for example. The GAN-based approach has pushed the field further by providing a new, robust classification algorithm that matches all the other cutting-edge algorithms. Speculatively, it is plausible to believe that GANs could generate candidate surgical procedures in the future to augment the work of surgeons. Similarly, GANs have been applied in drug discovery and protein folding applications and in dentistry, where people are already using this in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the ability to generate new data or imagery, GANs also have the capacity to be dangerous. A related, but algorithmically very different, technique has been making the rounds recently under the name “DeepFakes”, as in deep learning fake images. The ethical and geopolitical implications of this are vast because of its ability to create fake video footage of, say, political leaders discussing the use of military force against a country. Much has been discussed about the spread and dangers of fake news, but the potential of GANs to create credible fake footage is disturbing. If there is enough public footage, it may soon be possible to synthesize footage of events that never happened. Think of it as next generation Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GANs technique, was recently named as one of the Global Thinkers 2019 by Foreign Affairs. This is a major step towards AI being recognized as a key shaping force, especially in light of China’s aspirations for its AI industry to be worth $150 bn by 2030 and with European and other states spending tens of billions of dollars on AI budgets. Similar amounts were expended by the US alone, with sources claiming that in “its 2017 unclassified budget, the Pentagon spent approximately $7.4 billion on AI and the fields that support it.” Clearly, given the number of funds invested and the massive potential of this technology to shape the future geopolitical relations, the Foreign Affairs recognition should not come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the reasons why ethics is a key topic on everyone’s minds. I have covered this topic in my book, “GANs in Action: Deep learning with Generative Adversarial Networks”, with my co-author Vladimir Bok. GANs can do so much good for the world, but all tools have misuses. Here the philosophy has to be one of awareness: since it is impossible to “uninvent” a technique, it is crucial to to make sure that the relevant people are aware of this technique’s rapid emergence and its substantial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with this kind of growth and investment across all fronts of AI, advisory and professional groups are starting to emerge where industry professionals can meet, collaborate and discuss the benefits and dangers of techniques, such as the global network built by Brainpool.ai. In the future, I hope that these groups will go on to define public AI policy more than the public perception of AI and its dangers. Given the limited experience of politicians globally with AI, it’s vital that the industry informs the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the more geopolitical aspects of GANs technology, GANs represent an exciting new technology that can bring creativity into otherwise seemingly pseudo-deterministic Artificial Intelligence landscape. Ultimately GANs could free people from worrying about low-level logistics of how to perform tasks and enable them to focus on high-level ideas. To that end, GANs are one of the brightest hopes in AI innovation .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I apologise for the bad joke, but the original name of the article was “SELECT
FROM ai_threats ORDER BY danger DESC” and even though I cannot &lt;em&gt;possibly imagine
&lt;/em&gt;anything more exciting than a SQL query, I thought it detracted exactly the
types of readers I wanted to engage the most.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I witnessed a conversation on LinkedIn between two professionals who
both work in AI — albeit as non technical staff. This conversation was about
&lt;a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html"&gt;Google’s
AutoML&lt;/a&gt;,
a system that can automatically optimise itself to achieve better performance at
a given task. The tragedy stems from the wording that the Google research blog
has used: The article calls the two networks controller and a child. Then the
article went on to explain that AI designed can outperform the human made ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say the term child has caused a mild panic as it has been reported
by several
&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-child-ai-bot-nasnet-automl-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-a8093201.html"&gt;mainstream&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/664713/google-artificial-intelligence-ai-child-NASNet-AutoML"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5146963/Google-supercomputer-creates-AI-child.html"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt;
such as &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5072741/google-nasnet-ai-child-reinforcement-learning/"&gt;the
Sun&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/googles-ai-clones-itself-smarter-more-powerful-man-made-one-1643413"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt;.
This panic stemmed from the framing along the lines of ‘AI creates its own
children that outperform humans’, but this inaccuracy is all too often because
AI researchers and AI practitioners do not do not participate in these debates.
Using the terms such as “child” and describing the output of this network as
smarter than what humans would design is sure to make for some good headlines.
However, describing what happened as “algorithm uses a set of predefined rules
to achieve a slightly better performance” is nowhere near as scary but it is
probably more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example above is more funny than anything else, but I think demonstrates a
deeper point that the AI discussion can stray far off from where the real
concerns are for the couple of years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I appreciate the public interest in AI safety, the interest of people
with limited technical experience and understanding of AI is ultimately lead to
a reframing of the debate that I think is actively unhelpful or even harmful to
the ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an AI practitioner, about to release an educational resource on &lt;a href="http://jakublangr.com/gans-code.html"&gt;Generative
Adversarial Networks&lt;/a&gt;, I feel the need to
frame this discussion in the way that I see it. Without a doubt, there will be
subjective judgements but given the state of the discussion I feel like this is
important contribution nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start off with the most controversial part: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/945581226424983554"&gt;in line with Francois
Chollet&lt;/a&gt;, a staff
researcher at Google and the author of one of the most popular deep learning
frameworks, I believe that artificial general intelligence is still very far
off. Therefore worrying about super intelligence is maybe not irrelevant but it
is definitely not urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied historians and AI researchers have long talked about this idea of
intelligence explosion. I’m not completely sure to whom I should credit this
line of reasoning but I first &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtxoNap_UBc"&gt;heard it from Dr Joanna Bryson lecturing at
Oxford Martin School&lt;/a&gt;. The lecture
is great and you should definitely listen to it, but the gist is: ultimately it
does not make sense to worry about artificial intelligence explosion. AI will do
much more damage simply by augmenting malicious human actors and helping them
reach scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively this makes sense: same as with nuclear weapons, AI is ultimately
just a technology and it depends how it’s going to be used by humans. This
coupled with the fact that in actual fact most AI is what some call “idiot
savants” and therefore &lt;a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90156089/trippy-stickers-trick-computers-into-thinking-a-banana-is-a-toaster"&gt;catastrophically failing in even minor cases of
deviation from the original
task&lt;/a&gt;,
leads us to the inevitable conclusion that superintelligence destroying humanity
is very unlikely to be a concern in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/nipsfoundation/videos/1552446408179926/"&gt;“decades to
come”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what then is in my opinion worth worrying about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia or other nation states augmented by AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first on this list is something that we have already seen. Except in the
future, just by applying existing, enterprise technology, this can be made much
more scalable and therefore dangerous. Not to mention that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/21/china-ai-world-leader-by-2030.html"&gt;China will invest
$150 billion into
AI&lt;/a&gt;.
(Though, to be fair, China has, compared to Russia, shown much less appetite to
get involved in OECD countries’ politics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare"&gt;hybrid warfare&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia"&gt;cyber attacks against nation
states&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"&gt;cybernetic sabotage of nuclear
programs&lt;/a&gt;, we are faced with a lot of
questions in the world that is in theory completely untraceable. The mounting
allegations of Russian meddling with the American election results certainly do
not help. What’s worse is that an assault this fundamental on the world’s most
powerful democracy &lt;a href="http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20171009-social-media-is-first-tool-of-21stcentury-warfare-and-it-s-cheaper-than-f35-sen-warner"&gt;has allegedly cost a quarter of what a F-35 fighter jet
would
cost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re anywhere else in the world and think that somehow the downfall of
America will not mean anything to you, think again. Not only is there evidence
of &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/study-russian-twitter-bots-sent-45k-brexit-tweets-close-to-vote/"&gt;Russian interference in the Brexit vote by the usage of a massive
sophisticated network of Twitter bots trying to sow discord into the British
society&lt;/a&gt;,
but there is also evidence of Russian meddling in the Dutch, German, French and
British election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if that doesn’t scare you, there is also substantial evidence that Cambridge
Analytica — Robert Mercer and other shadowy figures funded organisation — &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/04/nigel-oakes-cambridge-analytica-what-role-brexit-trump"&gt;is
ramping up its capacity to use data analytics and AI to influence the population
in the US and the
UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally if you examine the dynamics of these AI augmented attempts to stir
discord, they do so across every pre-existing social divide on both sides of the
fence. For example, foreign bots &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmaker-russian-trolls-trying-to-sow-discord-in-nfl-kneeling-debate/2017/09/27/5f46dce0-a3b0-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.4092dbceb812"&gt;have been detected in America both supporting
the NFL players and opposing
them&lt;/a&gt;,
criticising Trump and supporting him, as well as taking advantage of gender,
sexuality and identity issues to further divide American society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not get me wrong all these are in principle solvable, mostly again by AI, but
currently neither tech companies nor government are putting enough of an effort
to truly address them. And even if you believe that the paragraphs about are
just some crazy conspiracy theory, you have to recognise that this is at least
plausible and that we currently do not have any monitoring in place to prevent
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. AI destroying social fabric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/news/world/study-people-check-cell-phones-minutes-150-times-day"&gt;Remember that an average person checks their phone about 150 times a day and
think about what this does to ability to have social
interaction.&lt;/a&gt;
Also the perfect ever obedient technology is a really poor mental model for our
children on how to interact with the world and especially other humans. Make no
mistake: the software and hardware products you buy today are loaded with AI
that constantly learns how to capture your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not even mentioning that spending a lot of time on Facebook makes us
less happy; &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-facebook-investor-roger-mcnamee-urges-company-to-fix-their-product/"&gt;anger and outrage drives most of interactions on Facebook because
those illicit higher response
rates&lt;/a&gt;;
and the looming fear of automation is making many fair for their jobs there for
making them more anxious. This is not even diving into the problem of &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fake-online-news-spreads-through-social-echo-chambers/"&gt;online
echo chambers, which is a massive problem as the linked article
describes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when you think about the &lt;a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html"&gt;human colossus
&lt;/a&gt;and its most advanced
intelligence product: corporations, we run into another quagmire. This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/939968291363225602"&gt;tweet
&lt;/a&gt;summarises it well:
“Just super amazing how people immediately see the problem with “what if an AI
were designed to create paperclips at all costs” but don’t see a red flag in
“we’re going to design our entire society around a mechanical social process
that maximizes for short-term capital growth”. Coporations are the original
super intelligence, because they aggregate knowledge of dozens of humans in
pursuit of one goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution for now definitely is to just t&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/best-of-tech-startups/dfj-thought-leaders-making-technology-less-manipulative-tristan-harris-time-well-spent"&gt;hink about whether all the time you
spend with technology is time well
spent&lt;/a&gt;
and in the long run start thinking about the psychological effects automation
and universal basic income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Non-state actors augmented by AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third angle has to do much less with nation-states or corporations and much
more how independent people or groups of individuals can act. I will only give
you a glimpse of what I mean as I believe this one is less urgent and we’ll keep
shortening with decreasing importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus I’ve already mostly explained and a lot of the bears a thing as similar as
in the nation state example except now or dealing with much more decentralised
group with much fewer resources. &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/the-4th-industrial-revolution-and-international-security/"&gt;But people are only thinking about it in terms
of the security
ramifications&lt;/a&gt;
and autonomous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally believe the nation states will be able to co-ordinate via UN or
otherwise to maybe ban development but most likely usage of &lt;a href="http://autonomousweapons.org"&gt;autonomous weapons
technology&lt;/a&gt;. I do not believe, however, that the
non state actors will adhere to the same standards when it comes to the
s&lt;a href="http://autonomousweapons.org/slaughterbots/"&gt;laughter bots&lt;/a&gt; and similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already happening in tiny doses; groups like Anonymous and platforms
like Silk Road have demonstrated government’s incapacity to deal with actors
that fall outside their scope. Especially if their host government proves
uncooperative. So we may have to deal with things like cyber-terrorism, hackers
at an unprecedented scale and automated political propaganda from non-state
actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Super intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I wanted to put super intelligence as fifth but then a few of my
friends under the influence of Google Deepmind’s safety team convinced me
otherwise. I will not argue about the timing of super intelligence; much has
been written about this topic by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will just say that there are &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@francois.chollet/the-impossibility-of-intelligence-explosion-5be4a9eda6ec"&gt;many researchers who believe not even if we
achieve singularity soon there will be limited impact on the
world&lt;/a&gt;.
Anecdotally, just think about the smartest kid in your High School class. How
far have they made it? Has their intelligence helped them so much? In fact, is
it even possible to construct a consistently more intelligent approach when we
consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization"&gt;that in optimization there is no free
lunch&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the argument here is that the growth of AI is exponential and so evolved
AI is to a human as say a human is to a horse. Horse will never be an inventor.
So it is quantitatively so much better that it is qualitatively different.
However this I also take an issue with, because people typically use biological
systems as an obvious parallel to AI without much justification. The growth of
AI is not like the growth of a human from a child to an adult. AI can solve many
problems with superhuman performance but a seemingly similar problem will be
virtually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although there are reasons that is super intelligence might have
the capacity to harm humans, remember that despite billions of dollars of
investment Siri still barely understand what you mean. Let’s say we completely
must do speech recognition in speech in synthesis in the next year (extremely
optimistic) and in the two years after that we manage to productionize this. In
the next five, we solve perception and in the five after that unsupervised
understanding and in the 10 after that common sense reasoning. But all (1–3) of
the above are things that are potentially happening &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. Does it still
seem that urgent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, I would love to pose to anyone this challenge: how do you even
imagine super intelligence to destroy humanity? Why would it even care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. AI just making mistakes or cutting corners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two problems are closely interlinked, because I don’t believe that anyone
wants to write AI that will make mistakes. But as I said this point is very
close fifth. Ultimately I believe that the chances are 50–50 that even if we get
to singularity, we will simply not know whether this is going to be completely
purposeful. In fact, we still &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530"&gt;do not really understand why deep learning works
completely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, AI researchers and practitioners will be under pressure from their
managers, sponsors or other stakeholders and therefore forced to cut corners. To
be fair to the public debate, I think this is the one point where spreading
awareness — however rudimentary — is extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall as much as AI safety seems like a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/945581226424983554"&gt;fun problem that a lot of
philosophers were waiting for a long time, we should avoid judging the
technology by its
narrative&lt;/a&gt;; at least for
the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about 2 days to write this article. In this time, the initial story
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OriolVinyalsML/status/954243674182967296"&gt;has happened
again&lt;/a&gt;, which just
shows, in my opinion, how frequent those popular misinterpretations tend to be.&lt;/p&gt;

I was lucky to be selected as one of the participants in this project and now I am eager to share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year has passed since I started to make predictions for this fascinating project run by Philip Tetlock a man that has dedicated about 30 years of his life to understanding geo-political forecasting. Recently the project has ended so I would like to share some insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I would love to start with &lt;a href="hello-world.html"&gt;evaluation of my own lessons&lt;/a&gt;: I think that overall I ended up over-correcting for the biases I have read about, which is a fascinating lesson. I already mentioned this the &lt;a href="hello-world.html"&gt;first time I was writing&lt;/a&gt; about Good Judgment Project (GJP). At least based on my rudimentary understanding the calibration and observation, it seems that normally people have the opposite bias and the curve is flipped around the 45 degree line (the picture below is from the report I received from Good Judgment Project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/calibration_curve.png" alt="(Calibration)" align='right' height='300px' weight='300px' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second point about randomness was just due to my un-rigorous understanding of randomness that I think I now understand: the problem is that something is random given a certain distribution (so we cannot make a better guess than the observed distribution for any particular observation). My third lesson about conditional probability still remains fair, which is: it is difficult to make it correctly, but as Philip Tetlock correctly pointed out, this is the way forward, because it allows us to get exactly the probabilities we care about: if we do X what will the world do? (Because we do not care about if Iran will build a nuclear bomb, we want to know IF we do nothing will Iran build a nuclear bomb?) 
sting as the project I have been using much during GJP--but they will "soon" be announcing what they are doing next, but who knows what that will entail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the results rolled in they were not too bad, I ended up being the 71st percentile, with my imputed scores dragging me down a little (this was necessary, because you could not answer all the questions, though maybe I also picked questions I understood better). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/mean_brier.png" height='400px' width='800px' align='center' /&gt;
&lt;img src="Public/blog/density_imputed_comparison.png" height='400px' width='800px' align='center' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the overall results were quite decent, but I certainly I have loads to learn! While Philip Tetlock certainly tries to help us mere mortals in the &lt;a href="http://edge.org/conversation/philip_tetlock-edge-master-class-2015-a-short-course-in-superforecasting-class-iii"&gt;the political forecasting by giving us better insight in the Edge online seminar&lt;/a&gt;. I have not watched all of them, but they seem amazing so far! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what GJP mainly showed me is the power of prediction markets: we can not only &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813062234/http://www.columbia.edu/~bc2656/GooglePredictionMarketPaper.pdf"&gt;use them in companies to guide our own progress&lt;/a&gt;, but we can also use them to &lt;a href="https://home.inklingmarkets.com/"&gt;get a glimpse into the future like Inkling Markets does&lt;/a&gt; by pooling our predictions together in a crowd-sourcing manner. This last link is particularly interesting, as I feel this has &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; commercial applications if only people cared enough about evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Tetlock outlines what are the necessary ingredients of good forecasting and he mentions that the best forecasters tend to be publicly minded software engineers, which is partially supported by the Google information flow study and generally it seems that the more quantitative the subject the better you are likely to be as one political forecasting study finds that the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614075429/http://www.hamilton.edu/documents/Analysis-of-Forcast-Accuracy-in-the-Political-Media.pdf"&gt;best forecasters in US politics&lt;/a&gt; "tend to be liberal and not lawyers" (most of the good ones were economist, interestingly). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think there is a potential array of problems: are we not likely to fall into the same illusion as with actual financial markets? E.g. that they are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; efficient and therefore we should almost blindly trust them (as seems to be the narrative in the Conservative US politics)? Surely, given that we now know that most people are not better at forecasting than random (though this may be because all of the stastically efficient arbitration has already been done in financial markets by the algorithmic hedge funds). I think this is up for discussion, but I would definitely not try to apply them to policy debates blindly &lt;a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/352406.html"&gt;as some authors do&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prediction markets avoid these problems. There is no question of who the experts are: anyone can invest in a prediction market. There's no question of special interests taking it over; this just distributes free money to more honest investors.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other problem is that while applications in business are fascinating, the sample sizes with exception of &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; (and data-driven?) companies such as Google, there may always be too small of an interest to make this a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should just stick to talking to each other for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="prediction markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Speaking at European Economic Congress 2015</title><link href="jakublangr.com/eec-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-30T21:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-06-30T21:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-06-30:jakublangr.com/eec-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a personal post about my experience speaking at an international conference and what I think the trouble with policy-makers trying to spur entrepreneurship is.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently invited to speak at European Economic Congress in Poland partially thanks to the fact that I was working at Aspen Institute Prague back in the summer of 2011. When I saw the line-up for my panel I was a bit terrified: why should anyone care what I had to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="Public/blog/panel.png" alt="Panel line up" align='center'
 style="width: 95%; height: auto " /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;To Poland!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the Katowice airport, there was even a guy standing with my name (laminated!) on it waiting to escort me to the hotel. That freaked me out a little bit. Katowice was an interesting city: marred by Communist rule and somewhat this felt like a journey back in time -- recalling my childhood days in Prague. Poland was noticeably different from Czech Republic, but was eerily similar in some of the functionalist buildings and social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never properly been to Poland before except for the couple of times I have barely crossed the border like when I was climbing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn%C4%9B%C5%BEka"&gt;Sněžka&lt;/a&gt;, so it was good to have this opportunity to visit! Unfortunately and perhaps fittingly with the atmosphere of a predominantly communist era city, it was quite cold the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;img src='images/IMG_20150420_175640.jpg' alt='Katowice' style="width: 99%; height: auto "&gt;     
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
        &lt;img src="images/IMG_20150420_103638.jpg" alt="President speaking" style="width: 99%; height: auto "&gt; 
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference itself was held in a fabulous newly built Conference Center in the middle of Katowice. It was started off by the then President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski. Despite not being explicitly on the agenda, he started discussing the issue of entrepreneurship quite a lot: the issue of retaining talent, attracting investors and so on. Although there were no concrete plans, I still appreciated this as a very important signal as well as the recognition that entrepreneurship is hard and if we want to succeed we must embrace failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic was great because that is one of the topics I am passionate about. I think that it is one of the great equalisers in a society as well as an important skill for anyone to pick up. The trouble with entrepreneurship in Europe though is that the social attitudes it encourages are actively decreasing the pool of potential entrepreneurs. Like the fact that our educational systems does not encourage students to experiment and fail at all: neither in the Czech Republic nor at my University (a top UK university). I am fairly sure that most of my teachers and classmates thought I was incredibly arrogant while I was only trying to follow evidence and best practice from people around the world. It took courage to do that and sure I am sure that as a person I have an incredible amount to work on, perhaps more than most, but I still think that I was politely ignored at best and actively discouraged at worst is indicative of why Europe has no major successful start up to speak of with the &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies"&gt;possible exception of Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly talk about digital entrepreneurship, because that is where most of my expertise comes from but I think that ultimately, this should generalise to most areas. While I value greatly that the policy makers have taken on such an challenging topic, I have to highlight that the absence of anyone except old white men among the attendees and the whole spirit of the conference was very much in the style of a conference for them, thereby missing almost the entire population and I really hope that business is more inclusive that that. Or at the very least it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of discussion, obviously, I was not expecting something like &lt;a href="/web-summit-dublin-14.html"&gt;my experience at Web Summit Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, which specialises on tech entrepreneurship, but there was also a massive disconnect between a lot of people were saying and what really needed to happen. Which is a shame, because I think that there is so much direct and obvious stuff that the policy makers could do to ease entrepreneurs' lives: less bureaucracy, encouraging educational system that rewards experiments and reasonable welfare state that does not make failure too costly.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Panel! (SLightly egotistical pictures, don't judge me)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td &gt;
        &lt;img src='images/240627_940.jpg' alt='Panel 3' style="width: 95%; height: auto "&gt;

        &lt;img src="images/240621_940.jpg" alt="Panel 2" style="width: 95%; height: auto " &gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br &gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the typical cliches were then repeated during my panel discussion: how it would be so great to have more European entrepreneurship, young people should do it (which is also not true: anyone has a shot!) and why do all the smart people go abroad? Unfortunately, the reality that it is often too costly financially and socially (also in terms of exit options) to create a new company in Europe and the real issues were sometimes completely missing. On the plus side, during the discussion I got a few shout-outs from others such as "As the gentleman on the far-right [of the panel] noted--without alluding to his political views--the young need to be willing to fail", as mentioned by the German ambassador. Though I was the only one to laugh at that remark, which was quite embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I think that it was great that we discussed this topic at all, but I think that Europe--if it is serious about entrepreneurship--needs to examine systematic social causes and start doing rather than merely talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I had a great time in Poland. I think I still learnt loads from this conference and I had an opportunity to have a drink with some of my great former colleagues from Aspen!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="entrepreneurship"></category></entry><entry><title>Web Summit Dublin 2014</title><link href="jakublangr.com/web-summit-dublin-14.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-14T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-11-14T20:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-11-14:jakublangr.com/web-summit-dublin-14.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An amazing week filled with learning about tech and startups, in the presence of inspiring people, cool businesses and most importantly fellow scholars--probably the most awesome group of people in existence.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I rarely get this emotional about an event, but Web Summit definitely is an experience I will never forget. I was incredibly lucky to be &lt;a href="http://blog.websummit.net/student-blog-announcement/"&gt;selected as one of the 22 initial Student Scholars&lt;/a&gt; to give free attendance to Web Summit Dublin 2014. When I was applying little did I know how awesome this experience will be. When they told us that we were selected out of 6,600 applicants (final figure was apparently at 15,000 for all rounds), I was a bit skeptical. When I saw the list of people I was supposed to be going to the Summit with, my only thought was: "I don't belong here".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it got to term time I did not quite have the brain capacity to worry about this. But somehow, when it eventually got to the Summit itself, I was not sure what to expect. I did not know anyone from the group of scholars and even the arrangements from the Summit with regards to our arrival were very much in the start up mentality -- hectic and required some figuring out. (That is not to blame the team at all, everything that was supposed to work, worked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2 am bus ride to catch my 6 am flight was somewhat annoying, but hey, if it is to go such an amazing event, why not. Actually, it feels kind of boring to travel during regular hours. Already on the bus to the hotel, I met up with two other scholars and I immediately felt at home: super interesting people one of whom went to business school the other to medical school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day we did some serious sightseeing with those who arrived a bit early, as the first event was in the evening. Some people really wanted to go on the Hop On, Hop Off bus tour, which I though was quite touristy, but felt like I should try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-03%2013.55.12.jpg" alt="Excited tourists" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-03%2013.10.56.jpg" alt="Yay bus tour!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely no regrets, we got to see a lot of Dublin that we normally would not have any time to see. Then it was time for our first pub crawl. These were integrated into Web Summit and there was even a special pub crawl for the scholars with some of the more successful companies at the Summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise that the networking was awesome. But what is far more important: it felt really natural. I always hated networking for the sake of networking. I wanted to meet new people and make friends. And if they happen to be useful connections, great. If not, it's still a win, you have an awesome friend. That is really what made it so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we were escorted to dinner at Guinness factory, where on the top floor some speakers (Drew Houston!!!) along with scholars were all having dinner. I think I even shook Drew's hand so that already made me quite happy. Plus I just casually happened to speak to the CEO of Idea Paint. Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the dinner we moved to the Night Summit, which was a street rented out by Web Summit so that the attendees of the Summit can wind down and talk to each other over a pint. I think I came home at about 2 or 3 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="Public/blog/IMAG0803.jpg" alt="Guiness Dinner with Drew et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2008.42.05.jpg" alt="Yay start up exhibition hall!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, it was start of the Summit's main part, which was absolutely &lt;em&gt;mind-blowing&lt;/em&gt;. So many awesome start-ups to talk to, the picture above only barely describe my excitement when I saw the main exhibition hall. But also, there were about seven stages that were full of the super stars of tech community: Tim O'Reilly (sorry for the bad picture), Peter Thiel (I missed the book signing :( ), GitHub CTO and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2013.23.04.jpg" alt="Tim O'Reilly" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2016.35.56.jpg" alt="Peter Thiel" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Night Summit made me happy to be missing sleep again. But we went to have drinks at the Lord Mayor of Dublin, which was amazing. Though at that time I was already spoiled, as earlier in the day we saw an opening of NASDAQ from Dublin by the Prime Minister of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2014.21.16.jpg" alt="NASDAQ Opening. NBD." align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" source="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-04%2018.18.52.jpg" alt="Lord Mayor of Dublin" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the last day had so much to offer: Bono, Dana Burnetti and many others. Paddy Cosgrave the main organizer handled everything excellently, though he was pointing out the issues with WiFi and how that is not really their fault a bit too often. (Though to me that did not pose a problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2017.19.28.jpg" alt="Bono et al" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2017.01.49.jpg" alt="Dana Burnetti" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also a week full of incredible occurrences: I randomly happened to speak to the founder of Twitch, without even knowing. One other scholar was just finishing his homework in the lobby of our hotel and happened to stumble upon Dave McClure -- the founder of 500 Start-ups -- the person who just a day earlier said on stage: "If you are going to pitch to my f*cking face [without being invited to], I am not going to listen to you". But at this time Dave was trying to set-up Node.js (&lt;a href="hack-zurich-14.html"&gt;framework that we all love&lt;/a&gt;) and my fellow scholar who happened to know Node got an internship offer for this one act of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-05%2022.33.40.jpg" alt="The Kooks!" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/2014-11-06%2014.51.41.jpg" alt="Dave McClure" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other story that I still struggle to believe is that the Kooks happened to be playing without many people even knowing about it in one of the Night Summit venues. I only found out about that less than an hour before the show from a friend of mine when we just happened to be randomly talking about what we are doing tonight. He forwarded me an email (that already was forwarded at least 5 times) that was saying that Kooks will be playing in one of the venues. I don't think that it was that the organizers were trying to hide this event -- it's just that so much else awesome was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, words cannot describe how amazing this event was. I have learned so much from other Summit attendees, especially the scholars. I have had many interesting, fun and inspiring conversations. So if you are still in university, keep an eye out! Organizers promised they will do it again next year and you don't want to miss that!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Web Summit"></category><category term="non-technical"></category><category term="Dublin"></category><category term="Start-up"></category></entry><entry><title>#hackZurich 2014: A hackhathon to remember</title><link href="jakublangr.com/hack-zurich-14.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-12T20:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-12T20:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jakub Langr</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-10-12:jakublangr.com/hack-zurich-14.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My experiences at #hachZurich (http://hackzurich.com/): 30+ hours of coding, 5 hours of sleep, 14 hours of transportation door-to-door and back. One epic weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you work with a lot of engineers, you start to envy all those cool personal projects they have and all those cryptic plug-ins they know and have mastered. A lot of this happened at Hackathons. So I wanted to try one myself to have a proper experience of trying to code up an app from scratch in less than 42 hours. So when I found about hackZurich, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I was. The hackathon looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;: more sponsors than any society or event I've seen. Cool APIs opened only for hackZurich and &lt;em&gt;they even reimbursed most of travel costs.&lt;/em&gt; The only annoying this was that this event was happening around exam time. But seeing as I am writing elaborate odes on this, you can probably guess what I chose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was not that easy: I knew I wanted to go to a hackathon, except I've never been before. And there was an application process. Realistically, I am not sure how selective it was, but there was a cap of 300 people and given that there are always freebies and free food, I think hackathons can be quite appealing.... at least for me. But I mean we had to sleep on the ground, on the tables and on our bags and some people did not even have sleeping bags. I do not want it to sounds like I am complaining. No one actually slept a whole lot (I slept about 4 hours first night and one hour the second) so no one really cared. I found my own non-lit corridor and slept on the floor, because I really need quiet environment. But hey! It was a fun experience and I was worried I am getting a little snobby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hacking! We had about 30-40 hours to code an app on any topic, but noting of course that some companies gave us exclusive (and some promoted only their existing) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; for us to try something new. Except, as a person knowledgeable mostly of the data science stack, I soon realized that I will need to go back to coding some web apps to have something to show. That, however, was a problem, because I have not coded up a web app in over a year. So I was afraid that I simply may not be up to the challenge skill-set wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, organizers created a Facebook group for people to get together and discuss their preliminary ideas, but standard hackathon rules apply: no code before the official kick-off. So I joined the group and was discussing ideas with people and was quite happy to see that a lot of people were not extremely concerned about the lack of specific skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I was quite nervous, because this was my first hackathon and I was not quite sure what to expect. I teamed up with a friend of mine, because I figured going to a hackathon in a different country in a busy period and coding in technologies I have never mastered and even the little experience I had was long time ago, it is going to be challenging as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We roughly discussed the idea beforehand, but as my head was full of Mathematical Methods exam that I was supposed to be taking the day before leaving, I did not quite do justice to preparation as a lot of Node JS I needed to refresh on the go and that slowed me down considerably. But let's not jump the gun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing my exam on Thursday and doing chores until my departure from Oxford shortly after noon, I was quite freaked out: I still haven't really unpacked and I was already going places. But the trip was cool: I was flying from London City Airport for the first time, which was quite exiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/IMAG0752.jpg" alt="Destination: #hackZurich" align="center" style="width: 620px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not knowing anything about Zurich, I perfectly navigated and caught the pre-planned (from about a week ago!) train straight to the hackathon venue, which made my day. Hackathon itself was held at a &lt;a href="http://technopark.ch"&gt;TechnoPark&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed to be a quite modern open space for start-ups and small companies. Upon arrival, I got my badge and bag of goodies that I still haven't fully explored, because there's just &lt;em&gt;so much stuff.&lt;/em&gt;  (Yay!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I unfortunately missed the opening ceremony, but I arrived just in time for the pretty cool workshops: Evernote had an introduction to their APIs and Software Development Kits and then I went to presentation about Google wearables. Where Google-certified android master (presenter) sent a guy who wanted to go to the Apple workshop to the 6th floor (where there was no workshop) and after the poor guy left, he said: "Ooops, I must have been using Apple Maps." The sass is strong with this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the workshops, &lt;strong&gt;let the hacking commence.&lt;/strong&gt; My friend and I were using MEAN stack and &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.JS&lt;/a&gt; to build a budget tracking app. That is &lt;a href="http://mongodb.org"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express.JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular.JS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.JS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was challenging doing all this coding, but I have to say, quite fun. The atmosphere was amazing and a ton of caffeinated drinks around. Here and there was an occasional food shortage, but hey: free food. After the kick-off people, obviously, started coding. And they coded... until 430 am. At which point I decided that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a good idea to get some rest and so I finally managed to find a nice hallway to sleep in by about 5 am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think that was bad? Check out where some of these poor souls have been sleeping:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my effort to stow myself away I was woken up several times by people sneaking through my corridor to find an even more obscure corridor to sleep in, which sometimes looked quite weird, not to mention awkward, especially if you make eye contact. Anyways, I woke up by 8:30 am to sounds of some radio (&lt;strong&gt;rage&lt;/strong&gt;) and since I was up and I got breakfast and started working. Morning was quite productive, but after a while we got quite tired and hungry and so we went on a walking tour of Zurich that organizers kindly organized for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/IMAG0765.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/IMAG0767.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;1
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="Public/blog/IMAG0771.jpg" alt="Finders, sleepers" align="right" style="width: 310px;"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say Zurich is quite an amazing city. It has a very picturesque, small-town feel and it really feels too fairly-taily to be true.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night was a bit more rough as we had issues with our database and Node.JS not being synchronized, which is one of the pains of working with asynchronous stacks, which took us quite a long time to fix. I stopped working at around 4:30 and got up at 6 something to go finish our app before the 930 am deadline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our app did not make it into finals--as those were only for 1/4 of the participants--but this hackathon was definitely awesome. Would do again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I yammered for too long again, I will leave it at that, but I will be back for more!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hackathon"></category><category term="non-technical"></category></entry></feed>
